# Hello Sensor MAMN01
This is a project for the course Advanced Interaction design at LTH. The code is a combination of self written code and code from the sources listed below. The main menu is self built, with some inspiration from "Build your first app". The compass component is a combination of copied code from "Create your own compass" and modifications with inspiration from "SensorManager", "SensorEvent" and "Sensor". The accelerometer component is mostly self built with some inspiration taken from "Motion sensors".
